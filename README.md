# AI-for-Autonomous-Vehicles
Explore AI and ML fundamentals in image segmentation. This repo covers supervised learning (Perceptron Algorithm, Neural Networks) and unsupervised learning (K-Means, DBSCAN). It provides practical examples and algorithm comparisons, ideal for learning AI basics and application in image analysis.


## Introduction
One common application of machine learning is image segmentation, which divides images into meaningful groups. It's used in surveillance, medical imaging, and more.

## Problem Definition
This project focuses on using the K-Means algorithm for image segmentation, a crucial step for object detection and tracking.

## Step into Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) simulates intelligent behavior. It includes hardcoded rules and methods to evaluate future states.

## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning maps inputs to outputs based on labeled examples, like recognizing objects or translating languages.

### The Perceptron Algorithm
An early machine learning model, still relevant today in advanced methods.

### Neural Networks
Foundational in deep learning, used in complex systems like self-driving cars.

## Unsupervised Learning
Finds patterns without labeled data, used in clustering and anomaly detection.

### Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm
Connectivity-based clustering approach, useful in various fields.

### DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm
Density-based clustering, efficient in separating clusters.

### K Means Clustering Algorithm
Groups data points into clusters, used here for image segmentation.

### Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering
Distribution-based method for identifying clusters.

## Comparison of Clustering Algorithms
Evaluates performance and efficiency of K-Means, DBSCAN, and Gaussian Mixture.

## Conclusion
Machine learning offers supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. K-Means was chosen for its advantages in this assignment.
